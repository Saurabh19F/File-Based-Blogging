# File-Based-Blogging

File-based Blogging System


Blogging platforms allow users to publish content, share ideas, and interact with readers. Creating a file-based blogging system using Node.js will help you understand server-side programming, file handling, and building a simple content management system.


Your task is to create a blogging system where blog posts are stored as individual files on the server. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts. Each post should be stored in a separate file, and the system should be able to list all posts and display individual post content.


Goals and Objectives:


To design and develop a file-based blogging system using Node.js.

To demonstrate the ability to use Node.js for server-side development and file handling.

To ensure the application includes functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.


Steps to Complete the Task:


1. Set Up the Project - Create a new project directory. Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init. Install necessary packages (e.g., express for the web framework, body-parser for handling form data).


2. Directory Structure - Create a posts directory where blog post files will be stored. Create subdirectories for routes, views, and public for organizing routes, templates, and static files respectively.


3. Setting Up Express - Create an app.js file to set up the Express server. Configure the server to use middleware for parsing request bodies and serving static files.


4. Creating Routes - In the routes directory, create routes for the following:

Home Route: Display a list of all blog posts.

New Post Route: Display a form for creating a new blog post.

Create Post Route: Handle form submission and save the new post as a file.

Read Post Route: Display a single blog post based on its filename.

Edit Post Route: Display a form for editing an existing blog post.

Update Post Route: Handle form submission for updating a post and save changes to the file.

Delete Post Route: Handle the deletion of a blog post file.



5. Handling Blog Posts - Use Node.js fs module to interact with the file system. Each blog post should be stored in a separate file within the posts directory. File naming convention can be based on post titles or a unique identifier.


6. Views and Templates - Use a templating engine like EJS or Pug to create views for different pages. Create templates for listing posts, displaying a single post, and forms for creating and editing posts.


7. Styling with CSS - Create a styles.css file in the public directory. Add basic styles to enhance the visual appeal of the application. Style the post list, individual post view, and forms to make them user-friendly and visually appealing.


8. Middleware and Utilities - Use body-parser middleware to handle form submissions. Create utility functions for reading, writing, updating, and deleting files in the posts directory.


9. Running the Server - Ensure the server is set up to listen on a specified port. Provide instructions for running the server locally (e.g., using node app.js).
